# Analysing_weather_data
#### Project Overview
###### This project involves analyzing a weather dataset to gain insights into weather conditions, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and visibility. The dataset is available on Kaggle and contains the following columns:

###### Date/Time: The date and time of the recorded weather data.
###### Temp_C: Temperature in degrees Celsius.
###### Dew Point Temp_C: Dew point temperature in degrees Celsius.
###### Rel Hum_%: Relative humidity percentage.
###### Wind Speed_km/h: Wind speed in kilometers per hour.
###### Visibility_km: Visibility in kilometers.
###### Press_kPa: Atmospheric pressure in kilopascals.
###### Weather: Description of the weather condition.

# Questions & Analysis
###### 1)Find all unique "Wind Speed" values in the data:
###### 2) Analyze and list all distinct values recorded for wind speed.
###### 3) Find the number of times when weather is 'exactly clear':
###### 4) Count occurrences of the weather condition described as 'clear'.
###### 5) Find the number of times when wind speed was exactly 4 km/h:
###### 6) Determine the frequency of wind speed being precisely 4 km/h.
###### 7) Rename the column 'Weather' to 'Weather Condition':
###### 8) Update the column name for clarity.
###### 9) What is the mean of visibility in the data?:
###### 10) Calculate the average visibility across all records.
###### 11) What is the standard deviation of pressure in the data?:
###### 12) Compute the standard deviation of atmospheric pressure values.
###### 13) What is the variance of relative humidity in the data?:
###### 14)Determine the variance of the relative humidity values.
###### 15) Find all instances when snow was recorded:
###### 16) Extract records where the weather condition indicates snow.
###### 17) Find all instances when wind speed is above 24 km/h and visibility is 25 km:
###### 18) Filter and list records with wind speed exceeding 24 km/h and visibility of 25 km.
###### 19) What is the mean of each column against each element of weather condition?:
###### 20) Calculate the mean value for each column grouped by weather condition.
###### 21) Show all instances where the weather condition is fog:
###### 22) Display records where the weather condition is described as fog.
###### 23) Find all instances where weather is clear or visibility is above 40 km:
###### 24)Identify records where the weather is clear or visibility exceeds 40 km.
